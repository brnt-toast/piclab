## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## What was Learned 
### 1. Worse is Better Principal  
It is not only valid, but true. When faced with a deadline, while faced with  the challenge of using a completely foreign tech stack. It is imperative to break the problems down  into bit size atomic pieces. 
### 2. Iterate Iterate Iterate 
Following the `Worse is Better Principal` -- Just Start. 
* Start with a Skelaton.
* Build Atomics into Molecules into Organisms.
### 3. Refactor Refactor Refactor
TDD/BDD basically preaches this. Just get something on the page then refactor like mad. Atleast have an `MVP` or `Protoype` to be able to show something.
